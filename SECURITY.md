# Security Policy

Responsible disclosure
- If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the maintainers.
- Send details (steps to reproduce, affected versions, PoC) to: security@your-domain.example (replace with a real address).

Response expectations
- Acknowledgement within 48 hours.
- Initial triage and suggested timeline within 5 business days.
- Critical severity: 72-hour response target for mitigation guidance.

Scope
- This policy covers the public core repository and any official published packages.
- Private / enterprise modules are out-of-scope for this public policy — security reports for those modules should be submitted to their maintainers according to the enterprise contract.

Reporting guidelines
- Provide as much detail as possible: steps, environment, versions, PoC, screenshots/logs.
- Prefer encrypted emails: include a PGP key if available. If you need a PGP key, request it from the security contact.

If you cannot contact us
- If you cannot reach the security email, open a private issue on the private project repository (if applicable) or contact the organization admins.

Disclosures
- We will coordinate with reporters about timelines and disclosure. Public disclosure will be delayed until a fix or mitigation is available.

Legal
- Please do not violate applicable laws when researching vulnerabilities. We will not pursue legal action against good-faith security researchers following this policy.
